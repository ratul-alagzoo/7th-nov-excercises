Work through the Getting started guide of the polars library (https://docs.pola.rs/user
guide/getting-started/
 ), then load the iris dataset included in the seaborn library 
(seaborn.load_dataset("iris") returns a pandas.DataFrame, which you can convert to a 
polars.DataFrame). Print the statistical summary of the data set (describe), and find the indices 
of the flowers with the smallest / largest petal length.
